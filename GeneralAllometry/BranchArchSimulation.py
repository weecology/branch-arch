The "branching driven" method is being used to ensure a positive output on the first try. You are welcome to change the parameters and try out the "termination driven" method, as well. Future development will provide loops to vary the existing parameters and generate figures and branching metrics (i.e., canopy volume) so a more rigorous test can be performed to match empirical data. Also, branch length and diameter will be allowed to vary so as to include terminal branching patterns in the analysis. Thanks for taking the time to look over this. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and incorporating an extention of this simulation into my initial data analysis. I hope you have fun playing with the methods and paramters! ~Zack"""
