Welcome to the project repository for my Ph.D. dissertation analysis! Each main directory represents a chapter of my dissertation. The documentation and metadata is still under development for each of my projects, but may be found  in text files named [`ArchitecturePresent.r`](https://github.com/weecology/branch-arch/blob/master/GeneralAllometry/ArchitecturePresent.r), [`README.txt`](https://github.com/weecology/branch-arch/blob/master/NC140/README.txt) or [`MetaDataPresent.R`](https://github.com/weecology/branch-arch/blob/master/UtahTarts/MetaDataPresent.R). Please, feel free to contact me or open an issue if you have any questions about my work. Thanks for visiting! ~Zack Brym
