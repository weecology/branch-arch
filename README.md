Welcome to the project repository for my Ph.D. dissertation analysis! 

Each main directory represents a chapter of my dissertation. The documentation and metadata remains in various stages of development. The key document for each of my projects are: 

- [`GeneralAllometry/README.txt`](https://github.com/weecology/branch-arch/blob/master/GeneralAllometry/README.md) <- PeerJ Submission!
- [`NC140/README.txt`](https://github.com/weecology/branch-arch/blob/master/NC140/README.txt)
- [`UtahTarts/MetaDataPresent.R`](https://github.com/weecology/branch-arch/blob/master/UtahTarts/MetaDataPresent.R). 

Please, feel free to contact me or open an issue if you have any questions about my work. 

Thanks for visiting! ~Zack Brym
